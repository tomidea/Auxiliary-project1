# This script would be able to do the following:
# Read the CSV file and create each user on the server, and
# add users to an existing group called developers
# The script will first check for the existence of the user on the system, before it will attempt to create.
# The user would have a default home folder
# Each user would have a .ssh folder within its HOME folder.
# For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, create an authorized_keys file and add the public key of your current user.
